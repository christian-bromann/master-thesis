\chapter{Requirements\label{cha:chapter3}}

The development of HbbTV applications these days is cumbersome and difficult to develop and test.
Even though tools like FireHbbTV\footnote{\url{https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firehbbtv/}}
seems to have found developers interest and attraction the workflow is still not even close to
current industry standards in web development. Tools like Selenium and Appium have prooven that
there is an high demand for developers being able to do develop and test their software in a real
life environment.

With the shift to a more agile software development in the industry it also proofs the demand
to run automated tests in an iterative and quick development cycle. This can only happen
with proper tooling. Software development in browsers or on mobile devices already successful
entered that space of rapid development and quality ensurance using CI/CD. A tool that
tries to bring HbbTV app development to the same point has to build on this strategy. Since
HbbTV apps are not much different to normal webapps in their core technology it would be confusing
and unhelpful if continuous integration and continous delivery would be a different process here.
Therefor the tool has to be based on existing standards around automated testing and development.
It should not only support a seamless integration to already existing tools but also allow
developers to keep their current common practices in building apps similar if not equal to other
areas of web development.

The referred tool will be as outlined in section \ref{sec:scope} and more detailed descriped in
the concept section of this thesis (section \ref{cha:concept}) a piece of software seperated
into two components. Both have individually different requirements. The main goal of the first
component called \textit{Devtools Backend} is to provide developers an integration to the
Chrome Devtools so that they can inspect and debug their HbbTV applications. The other
component called \textit{Appium HbbTV Driver} will based on that component and should enable
to run automated tests based on the WebDriver protocol for arbitrary HbbTV applications on
arbitrary SmartTVs. Both components should be easy to use and integrate into a common and
familar development setup of web engineers.

% Functional requirements may be calculations, technical details, data manipulation and processing
% and other specific functionality that define what a system is supposed to accomplish.
\section{Functional Requirements\label{sec:reqsuba}}

\textbf{Devtools Backend}
- able to integare into standard development tools like Chrome Devtools
- work with arbitrary HbbTV apps
- support any TV Device
- should not break HbbTV pages
- should keep HbbTV app within a black box as good as possible

\textbf{Appium HbbTV Driver}
- transform WebDriver commands into Remote Debugging protocol commands
- has to integrate into existing automated testing tools
  - be used by any Selenium/Appium client
  - support for latets WebDriver specs
  - adapt TV specific attributes (that are not within WebDriver)
  - has to integrate with Selenium Grid to allow multiple TVs

\section{Technical Requirements\label{sec:techreq}}

\section{Social Requirements\label{sec:socreq}}

- e2e tests are hard, so this tool should be easy to use
- similar test tools out there already  it should be better

Component X must compete with Y. Hence, it is required to provide an excellent usability.
This includes ...
