\chapter{Evaluation\label{cha:chapter6}}

Looking back to chapter \ref{cha:chapter3} describing the requirements of the final product we will
evaluate the result and the usability of it in this chapter. The goal was to create a development
and testing environment for HbbTV applications that is comparable with the state of the art of
modern web development. Building web applications for the big screen turned out to be very cumbersome
since there are no tools that help the developer to understand what is going on on the TV. Common
workarounds are self build logging overlays on the developed application which might give information
about certain variable states but don't disclose the insides of the app at all. The DevTools Backend
component is the first tool that allows HbbTV developer to actually inspect a wide variety of aspects
of an HbbTV application.

\end{figure}

It not only allows to look into the DOM tree of the app but also modify elements and their CSS
properties. Developer have now the opportunity to build the app directly on the TV instead of
having to implement it on a browser first to then test it on a real Smart TV. Instead building
a custom logging mechanism it automatically captures all logs from the page as well as JavaScript
errors being thrown. In addition to that the \textit{Console} tab of the DevTools application
allows to execute any random JavaScript code within the context of the HbbTV page. With that it
can inspect variables of your application during runtime.
