\chapter{Implementation\label{cha:chapter5}}

Chapter 5 describes the implementation part of your work. Don't explain every code detail but emphasize
important aspects of your implementation. This chapter will have a volume of 15-20 percent of your thesis.

This chapter describes the implementation of component X. Three systems were chosen as
reference implementations: a desktop version for Windows and Linux PCs, a Windows Mobile
version for Pocket PCs and a mobile version based on Android.
