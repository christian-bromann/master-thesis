\chapter{State of the Art\label{cha:state_of_the_art}}

There are literally two main standards/protocols that are used in this thesis and will be described in
depth in this chapter: the HbbTV standard and the Webdriver protocol. Both are fairly new standards that
have been defined within the last 5 years. Another important protocol for this work is the Chrome Remote
Debugging protocol which is used by the automation driver to drive the Webdriver tests get data out of
the HbbTV app. This thesis tries to connect the standards to allow interoperability between them to
increase the level of integration to a wide variety of tools that has not been possible before.

\section{HbbTV\label{sec:hbbtv}}

% It's always a good idea to explain a technology or a system with a citation of a prominent
% source, such as a widely accepted technical book or a famous person or organization.

- what makes a smart TV a smart TV?
- time consuming and expensive to deploy all apps on all content provider
- hbbtv is the first standard that works across devices
- one deployment reaches all devices and customer
- app delivery
- show diagram
- support in the market (with examples of some countries like germany or france)
- Where it is supported elsewhere (where considered, what are hurdles)
- long term plans for HbbTV (HbbTV v2.0, with its features)
- estimated support
- What is required to use HbbTV
- Who defines whether or not a devices is supported

\subsection{The Standard in Detail\label{sec:hbbtvstandard}}

- Where is it defined
- What does the standard contain
- specification overview from HbbTV 1.0 - 2.1
- supported web standards from v1.0 - 2.1
- How does it differ from other standards
- which HbbTV version supports which W3C features or features in general

\subsection{HbbTV Runtime Environment\label{sec:hbbtvruntimeenvironment}}

- What's the lifetime cycle for HbbTV apps
- see spec (autoload etc.)

\subsection{Development of HbbTV Applications\label{sec:devofhbbtv}}

- How do engineer build HbbTV apps these days (show HbbTV app boilerplate)
- What are typical app structures
- What kind of tooling does already exist (HAT project)

\subsection{Available test solutions\label{sec:availabletestsolutions}}

- How do engineer ensure quality of HbbTV apps
- give a glimb of existing product and reference of chapter 6

\section{Test Automation\label{sec:testautomation}}

For internal references use the 'ref' tag of LaTeX. Technology B is similar to Technology A
as described in section \ref{sec:hbbtv}.

\subsection{How Test Automation Changed the Industry\label{sec:howitchanged}}

- Study cases of how current top companies test their apps (not necessarry HbbTV)
- demonstrate how similar apps get tested these days
- outline the gap between both worlds

\subsection{History of Automated Testing\label{sec:history}}

- How Selenium and Appium has evolved

\subsection{Webdriver Protocol\label{sec:webdriver}}

- What is it
- Where is it supported
- How does it differ from previous JSONWireProtocol

\subsection{Cloud Solutions\label{sec:cloud}}

- How to do test automation in big scale
- compare different types of cloud solutions

\subsection{Tooling\label{sec:tooling}}

- What tools to use to run test automation
- What are their scope and restrictions

\subsection{Analysis of Test Automation Demand for TVs\label{sec:testautomationontv}}

- How do devices differ
- only input remote control
- what could the future bring to us?

\section{Chrome Remote Debugging Protocol}

- What is it
- for what is it used for
- what about other browser (remotedebug.org)
- somethine from https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/awesome-chrome-devtools

\subsection{Functional Principles of modern Web Browser\label{sec:howbrowserwork}}

- How browser work

\subsection{Communication between Chrome DevTools Frontend and the Browser}

- How does the devtools frontend gets all the data from the browser
- why does it not affect the performance

\section{HbbTV and Web Platform Tests}

- How HbbTV devices get tested
- how other standards get tested
- validator (http://hbbtv-live.irt.de/validator/, http://ligada-validator.com/)
