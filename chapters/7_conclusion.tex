More and more digital devices are getting connected to the internet and run applications that are build with web
technologies. The HbbTV protocol was the foundation of bringing the web on the big screen. This fairly new standard
now encounters the same issues of debuggability and testability as other device and software markets before, e.g.
mobile application development. Til today there is no solution that really addresses these issues. As the HbbTV
standard evolves and the device fragmentation increases the demand for qualitative tools for software assurance
rises too. This thesis solves these issues by connecting established technologies and protocols together to create
a testing and debugging solution that can be integrated in modern software development pipelines.

\section{Summary\label{sec:summary}}

% Explain what you did during the last 6 month on 1 or 2 pages!

The work on this thesis started with an in depth research phase on the HbbTV standard and current testing technologies.
Unfortunately there were no existing solutions found at this point. Some companies like BBC provided some ressources
of their own homegrown solutions\footnote{See BBC Hive Open Source Test Tools (\url{http://bbc.github.io/hive-ci/})}
that are suited for their requirements. However the goal of this work was to find way to make testing and debugging
of arbitrary HbbTV applications accessible to everyone. Therefor it has to be non oppinionated and should not prescribe
a certain way of how to do things. To evaluate the technical opportunities one of the first steps was to discover
the accessibility of a modern Smart TV. Using tools like WireShark a variety of interfaces could be discovered that
allowed mobile applications to e.g. remote control the TV and enable second screen technology. These interfaces also
gave insights on the device capabilities as well as their underlaying software. Given that there were multiple
manufactures with different Smart TV platforms that even have different interfaces based on their models this approach
of controlling a TV device turned out to not be very promising.

Another interesting view point were virtual machines that emulated an HbbTV environment on your operating system.
With the Opera TV Developer tools\footnote{\url{http://www.operasoftware.com/products/tv/tv-developer-tools}} the
company that made the Opera browser provided set of tools and software that even allowed developer to remote debug
HbbTV applications from the browser. With the Opera TV Emulator it was not only possible to debug the app using
the Chrome DevTools\footnote{\url{https://wiki.operatv.tv/display/OTV/Debugging}} it also allowed to run automated
WebDriver tests by attaching the ChromeDriver to the Chrome DevTools Session that was run by the WebKit engine inside
the emulator\footnote{\url{https://wiki.operatv.tv/display/OTV/Selenium+testing}}. The idea of being able use the
Chrome DevTools which is the most powerful tool these days to inspect modern applications and test HbbTV applications
using the WebDriver protocol which drives millions of automated tests on mobile and desktop every day seem to be
really compelling as a developer. However being restricted to an emulated environment is suboptimal and would at the
end not solve the problem of quality assurance in a market of high device fragmentation like in the TV market.

The requirements of todays software delivery processes have been clearly influenced by the principles of agile software
development. The demand to ship qualitive software faster also applies for TV market where advertisment campaigns
and broadcast content is getting rolled out constantly. To build a pipeline that provides such quick delivery cycles
it requires \textit{''an automated set of tools from code to delivery''}\cite{Lehtonen2015DefiningMF}. The tools
within the delivery process have to be highly interoperable to allow to build a pipeline that fits the developers
needs since every software is different. Therefor the debugging and testing platform for HbbTV has to be interoperable
too which it only can be if it relies on open standards and protocols. Selenium, which is now standardised under
W3C\footnote{\url{https://www.w3.org/}} as WebDriver, is such an open standard. It was developed as open source
software since 2004. As industry leader for automated testing it runs millions of tests every day in desktop and mobile
environments. To build a testing tool for HbbTV that is future proofed and aligns with todays software development
standards it only makes sense to build on top of this technology. The WebDriver protocol itself only defines an
interface of methods and properties to automate a browser. However it doesn't specify how the automation is being
implemented. Therfore there are dedicated driver softwares for each individual browser. These drivers use different
approaches to execute a certain WebDriver command on the application. Interestingly the driver for the Chrome browser
uses a protocol that also drives one of the most powerful tools to develop and debug modern applications in Chrome.
This protocol is called Chrome DevTools Protocol\footnote{\url{https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/}}
which describes an interface to interact with the browser on multiple different domains like DOM, CSS or Network. It
is build into WebKit which is a browser engine that drives a lot of other browser including Opera and Safari. The
browser that render HbbTV applications on Smart TVs are also mainly driver by WebKit. Unfortunately it can't be accessed
programmatically. The protocol still provides the ideal baseline for implementing a development and testing platform
since it can be integrated in tools like Chrome DevTools.

That being said the major programming effort for this thesis was to re-implement all interfaces that are described in
the DevTools protocol as a standalone script. The use case model was the Chrome DevTools application. The goal was to
create a script that once injected into a web environment can be used to connect to a Chrome DevTools application. To
provide support for the Network domain a proxy was developed that captures network packages requested by the
application. Obviously it is not possible to support all methods described in the protocol using just the JavaScript
API. In fact the protocol is very comprehensive, implementing all methods would be impossible time-wise. Therefor the
scope was limited to support the most important tools, e.g. the Element, Console and Network tab. By inspecting the
DevTools applications using the DevTools application itself and reverse engineer the communication between the
application and a normal website it was possible to adopt the sequence of events and commands to a standalone script.
This allowed an interesting in depth view of how modern HbbTV applications from private broadcaster like Pro7 or
public broadcaster like ARD/ZDF were build. It showed that many channels are using the same application framework
and only differ in design and content based on the brand.

The last part of the thesis was to build an automation driver to run WebDriver tests on Smart TVs running HbbTV
applications. Appium already established a framework for building automation drivers based on the WebDriver
protocol since they already provide drivers for different platforms like iOS, Android, Windows and Mac. Similar
to how ChromeDriver and SafariDriver automates their browser the HbbTV driver uses the implemented standalone
script to execute WebDriver commands on the application.

\section{Dissemination\label{sec:dissemination}}

% Who uses your component or who will use it? Industry projects, EU projects,
% open source...? Is it integrated into a larger environment? Did you publish any papers?

The Fraunhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems will use this tool in near future to build and test their
HbbTV applications on daily basis. Their TV laboratory will be equipped with a handful Raspberry Pis running the
Appium HbbTV Driver and DevTools Backend components to debug and run tests on different TV models. This will be the
foundation of a larger Selenium Grid that will allow to run tests on multiple devices at the same time. The code
itself will be documented and open sourced so that it can be improved by people that are interested in this software.

In addition to that a talk with the title \textit{''Appium for Couch Potatoes: an HbbTV Driver''} was proposed and
accepted at the Selenium Conference 2017 in Berlin\footnote{http://seleniumconf.de/}. It will introduce the Appium
HbbTV Driver component and will show off how to run automated tests on Smart TVs. Being able to test connected
devices using Appium fits perfectly into the vision of that open source software. Therefor the thesis was already
mentioned in 2016 at the Selenium Conference in London in a talk by Jonathan Lipps with the title \textit{''StarDriver
Enterprise Appium to the Future''}\footnote{Video available on YouTube: \url{https://youtu.be/e61OhZzbsEI?t=16m42s}}.
Other abstracts and talk proposals had been sent out but haven't got accepted til submission.
